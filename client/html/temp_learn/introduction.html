<p>Welcome to Cup. Cup is a open source project consisting of a compiler, build system and a package manager. It aims to
    retain the simple C-style memory management while having a modern and expressive syntax.</p>

<p>Cup is conveniently distributed as a single binary file which means it's portable in it's nature. Cup still can be
    installed using the <code>cup self install</code> command.</p>
